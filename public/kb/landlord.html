    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    
    <h3>What are your management fees and how are they structured?</h3>
    <p>Our management fees are dependent on which service package is chosen, with different rates for Essential, Professional, and Premium packages. All fees are only charged when rent is collected, so if there's no rental income, there's no management fee.</p>
    
    <h3>How do you screen potential tenants?</h3>
    <p>We conduct comprehensive tenant screening including credit checks, employment verification, previous landlord references, right-to-rent checks, and affordability assessments. We only recommend tenants who meet our strict criteria and can demonstrate they earn at least 2.5 times the monthly rent.</p>
    
    <h3>Who is responsible for property maintenance and repairs?</h3>
    <p>We coordinate all maintenance and repairs on your behalf. For our Professional and Premium packages, we have a network of vetted contractors and can authorize emergency repairs up to agreed limits. You'll receive detailed reports and invoices for all work completed.</p>
    
    <h3>How do you ensure legal compliance with rental regulations?</h3>
    <p>We stay current with all rental legislation including safety certificates, deposit protection, right-to-rent checks, and energy efficiency requirements. Our team handles all compliance documentation and ensures your property meets current legal standards.</p>
    
    <h3>How often will I receive updates about my property?</h3>
    <p>You'll receive monthly rental statements, quarterly property reports, and immediate notifications for any significant issues. Our Premium package includes detailed annual property condition reports with recommendations for improvements.</p>
    
    <h3>What happens if a tenant doesn't pay rent?</h3>
    <p>We have a structured rent collection process including immediate follow-up on late payments, formal notices, and legal proceedings if necessary. Our Professional and Premium packages include rent guarantee insurance options for additional protection.</p>
    
    <h3>Can I terminate the management agreement if I'm not satisfied?</h3>
    <p>Yes, all our agreements include a 30-day notice period for termination. There are no long-term contracts or exit fees. We're confident in our service quality and want you to stay because you're satisfied, not because you're locked in.</p>
    
    <h3>How quickly can you find new tenants for my property?</h3>
    <p>On average, we find suitable tenants within 2-3 weeks of marketing launch. Our extensive marketing reach across 15+ platforms and database of pre-qualified tenants helps minimize void periods and maximize your rental income.</p>
    
    <h3>Do you handle property inspections and condition reports?</h3>
    <p>Yes, we conduct thorough check-in and check-out inspections with detailed condition reports and photography. Regular interim inspections are included in Professional and Premium packages to ensure your property is well-maintained.</p>
